 # Introduction
* This project constitutes the practical part of my engineer's thesis: "Practical comparison of the effectiveness of speech recognition algorithms on the example of a dialogue system"
   
 # Credits
* The CoquiClient class was built upon the code published under stt.readthedocs.io.

 # Notes
* The code is in a rough state at the present, with in-depth documentation being exclusive to the theoretical part of my thesis. I intend to go over it and introduce appropriate comments in due time.
   * This includes a more exhaustive README file.
